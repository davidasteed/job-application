Project Purpose:  
  The Iron Yard front-end development full immersive, week 4, day 3

  Assignment:  Job Application
    "Learning Objectives

    Most of our browser JavaScript code will be "event-driven" - that is, much of it will execute when some event has occurred, such as the user clicks a button or changes an input field. This assignment will help you practice "handling" those events with functions that will perform some action. In addition, we'll get some more practice changing the DOM.

    Your Mission

    We'll start this project from a provided job application form page. It uses Bootstrap for some simple styling. We will be handling a few different events (see below) and performing various actions when they occur. One of these actions will be to send the form data to a server. This is where we will want to separate out our code into two modules: one to handle user interface (UI) events, and one to handle the data sending and receiving. In the future we may have many more different modules for different purposes."

Critical Path:
  1.  Write two js files containing two IIFEs:  Validate IIFE encapsulation of two simple eventhandler functions, creating a namespace, then exposing these functions to each other and to the browser without error.  *Note:  the two test functions will have the same variables within them*  The idea is to ensure that I can prevent variables of same name from clashing within the window.namespace.  Those "variables with the same name" should only be relevant within the called function scope.

  2.  complete the first eventhandler required for the assignment, and validate.

  3.  if first event handler function was validated, then complete and validate the rest.

  4.  If time permits:  work on adventure mode.
